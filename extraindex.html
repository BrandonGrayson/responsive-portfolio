            Welcome! Thanks for Visiting my Profile. My name is Brandon Grayson I'm a developer in the Philadelphia Region. I've
            always had a passion for games and computers which led me to consider programming back in 2019. I started by
            self-teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of resources like Udemy and codeacademy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of 11-16-2020 I've been enrolled in the PennLPS bootcamp offered through the University of Pennsylvania
            and will graduate 02-2020. These days you can catch me coding or doing something computer oriented, whens
            its time to relax you'll find me at the local gym getting a work out. When the opportunity presents
            itself you can catch me traveling... hopefully somewhere with good food.
          </p>
